### What is Heterotopia? And Why Escape it? 

"Escape Heterotopia" is a groundbreaking VR game that delves into these modern challenges through the lens of psychological and social theories. Inspired by Michel Foucault's concept of heterotopia and Marshall McLuhan's media theory, the game offers a unique experiential insight into the juxtaposition of contrasting spaces and the human psyche's response to them.

Foucault's idea of heterotopias \cite{foucault} - real places that are simultaneously physical and mental, embodying layers of meaning - is central to the game's design. The game features two mirrors leading to a sex hotel and an office, each reflecting different aspects of the player's identity. This setup embodies Foucault's notion of spaces that are both isolated and penetrative of societal norms, challenging players to navigate the complexities of these intertwined realms.

Marshall McLuhan's view of media \cite{mcluhan} as extensions of human faculties is deftly echoed in the game's design. The game splits the player's presence between two virtual environments, embodying McLuhan's notion that media shape our experiences and perceptions. This dual presence in distinct spaces resonates with McLuhan's insight that new technologies alter our interaction with the world. He noted, "These extensions not only amplify but also bring about an imbalance and amputations." This concept is mirrored in the game, where dividing controls between contrasting spaces intensifies the sense of fragmentation, a reflection of the disjointed nature of modern life. Through this, players are invited to experience and contemplate the intricate impact of technology on their perceptions and daily lives.

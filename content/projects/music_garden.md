I create an interactive device "music garden" with the belief in mind
> *music lives in everywhere*. 

It's a final project in class DES INV 23 at UC Berkeley. I appreciate support provided by Kuan-Ju Wu and Salih Berk Dincer.

### What is a music garden?
Music is a flow of emotion for human, similar for flora. Someone loves rainy, others prefer sunny days. So give them sunlight or water as they wish! When you touch the flower, it will play a voice of violin. You will trigger a song "Duet of flowers" when you interact with them all.
